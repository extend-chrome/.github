# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make
the open source community such a great community! 😊

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (i.e. repos
  that demonstrate the specific issue)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated
  meetup for the local community, ...
- **Code**: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code,
  commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It
  helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series,
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should
explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should
also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to
break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and
merge.

It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was
the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Does it resolve any known Github issues?
Adding a line "resolves #<issue number>" (e.g. "resolves #23") to the
description of your pull request or of a specific commit will automatically
close this issue once the pull request is merged.

### Major changes

We really want your help! We know how much work a pull request requires. Your
time and effort is important to us, so 🙏 remember the following:

> Be sure to discuss large changes by opening an issue before you submit a pull
> request.

When someone makes a big pull request without checking with the maintainers of a
project, it can be awkward 😬 if the changes are not welcomed by the project
maintainers.

We know pull requests take time and effort. Please remember that the maintainers
are the people 😅 who have to live and work with any changes to the project.

Please discuss large changes such as API, tooling, or coding style in an issue
before you submit a pull request. Wait until an organization maintainer approves
👍 the general idea and approach before you make your pull request.

> MAJOR changes that you have not discussed with us first are not likely to
> merged. 😢
