# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make
the open source community such a great community! 😊

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (i.e. repos
  that demonstrate the specific issue)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated
  meetup for the local community, ...
- **Code**: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code,
  commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It
  helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series,
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should
explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should
also contain tests.

### Big changes

We really want your help! We know how much work a pull request requires. Your time
and effort is important to us, so 🙏 remember the following:

> **tldr;** Please discuss large changes in an issue before you submit a pull
> request.

When someone makes a big pull request without checking with the maintainers of
the project, it can create an awkward situation if the change is not welcomed by
the project maintainers. Remember, the maintainers are the people 😅 who have to
live and work with any changes to the code.

Please discuss large changes such as API, tooling, or coding style in an issue
before you submit a pull request. Wait until an organization maintainer approves
👍 the general idea and approach before you make your pull request.

Major changes that you have not discussed with us first are not likely to
merged. 😢

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to
break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and
merge.

It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was
the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Does it resolve any known Github issues?
Adding a line "resolves #<issue number>" (e.g. "resolves #23") to the
description of your pull request or of a specific commit will automatically
close this issue once the pull request is merged.
