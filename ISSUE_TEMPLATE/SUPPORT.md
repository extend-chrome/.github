Hey there! If you need help or tech support this may not be the place to ask.
Please post a question on
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-extension)
first, since your question will help more people over there.

If you arrived here because you think our documentation is unclear, insufficient
or wrong, please consider creating an issue for the documentation instead.

Finally, if you've asked on Stack Overflow and you still don't have an answer,
please **clearly** explain your question and provide a link to your Stack
Overflow question. Be polite.

Please remember, your issue may be closed if you don't provide a link to your
Stack Overflow question.
